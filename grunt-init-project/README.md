# [Amber Smalltalk](http://amber-lang.net) application generator.

The intention of this tool is to automate the creation of Amber projects.
This tool is based on [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

It is conveniently integrated into the `@ambers/cli` commandline tool, which should be preferred over using this project directly with `grunt-init`.

Installation and initial getting started instructions can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amber#getting-amber).
